description:

This mod contains Tech Level 3 Engineering Stations directly buildable for all factions.

Cybran and UEF Stations mimic the fully upgraded T2 equivalents.
Upgrading costs have been added.

V1 matches Original FA balance.
V2 matches Patch 3598 build rates.
V3 matches FAF 3628 build rates.
V6 fixes bugs with texture, fixes lag issue with Sera Eng Stations, and retunes build times.

The Prayer: Aeon T3 Engineering Station
Quickly built, but lacks hp and most importantly range. 
Build power equivalent to fully upgraded Cybran station.
flimsy but efficient.

Iyathu-uhthe: Seraphim T3 Engineering Station
Highest build rate and -range at the expense of increased build time and higher costs. 
typical seraphim over-the-top unit.

further notes:
There are no custom models for Aeon and Seraphim stations. Both use their respective Tech 2 TMD model and icon.
Since I hope to eventually include better fitting models I did not bother to change textures or icons.
Please contact me if you want to contribute.

On the bright side, effects work properly. 

I decided to add up all upgrading costs, making the Cybran T3 station a pain to build, but it still is the cheapest, best performing all-round variant.
A side effect is the doubled file size of the mod.

Due to the Cybran and UEF stations being separate units they will not group with the corresponding original versions when double clicked or CTRL-Z'ed.
That is until I write a script to rectify that, or someone kindly supplies it to me 8).

There's supposedly a zoom pop issue with the "new" UEF T3 stations I was unable to reproduce.
I appreciate bug reports and balance suggestions.

enjoy~
